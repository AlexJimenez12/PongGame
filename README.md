# PongGame
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Python turtle module. The game features two paddles controlled by the players and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to prevent the ball from crossing the boundaries on each player's side.
# Features:
- Two-player gameplay: Players can control their paddles using the keyboard arrow keys (Player 1 uses 'w' and 's', while Player 2 uses the up and down arrows).
- Randomized ball movement: The ball starts off in a random direction to add unpredictability to the game.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score, displaying it on the screen.
- Boundary detection: The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom boundaries of the game window.
- Game over and victory messages: When a player misses the ball, a message is displayed to indicate the winner of the round.
# How to Play:
- Run the Python script.
- Use the designated keys to control the paddles:
- Player 1: 'w' to move up, 's' to move down.
- Player 2: Up arrow key to move up, down arrow key to move down.
The objective is to prevent the ball from crossing the boundaries on your side.
Each time the ball crosses the opponent's boundary, you earn a point.
The game continues until you decide to exit.
# Enjoy playing Turtle Pong!
